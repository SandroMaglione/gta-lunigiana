/**
 * Tyre smoke and dust: one InstancedMesh of low-poly puffs for the whole map, spawned from the
 * sim's Skid events in proportion to how far past its grip and how fast each tyre slides. Burnt
 * rubber is white-grey on asphalt and stone, dust tan on gravel and dirt, dark brown on leaves, and
 * grass hardly smokes; on snow it is white spray. A puff grows, rises, drifts and shrinks away over 1–2 s of sim time, so the
 * smoke hangs still while the game is paused. When every puff is in the air, the puffs owed meanwhile are dropped.
 * Drawn after the tyre marks (render order 1).
